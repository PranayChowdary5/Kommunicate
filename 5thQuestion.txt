5.If I want to start a software Company I will choose my friend Smaran and Kreethi as 
my partner beacause in our whole college life we encountered a lot of projects and we 
divided our projects into small chunks like agile process and each of us completed our 
work on time which makes a better team work.And also we handled lot pressure situations 
through those projects.So I choose them as my Partners.
